# Pi_Tweeter
A Raspberry Pi Twitterbot which can tweet selfies, random messages and sensor data, because why not!

It uses a Raspberry Pi B+, a Sense HAT and a Pi Camera, although you don't need anything more than a Raspberry Pi to do the basics.

Its Twitter account can be found here:  @piserver2015

For the record I can't guarrantee this will be up to date, but I will try my best!
